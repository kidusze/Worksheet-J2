# Worksheet 2

1.
```
Basic type = int a; double b;
```
```
Object = String s
```
2. <p> (a) Static method:- it is a declaration for classes which allows data and function to be accessible within the class without having to instantiate an object instance of that class as an object. <br> (b) When we are executing the main method of a class we're not instantiating an instance of the class as an object and then calling main. We are essentially calling the main directly or statically without an instance.

3. <p> Problem 1 = Wrong, because it is using the '==' operator to comapre two strings, which checks for reference equality rather than value equality. The  string choice is created as a new String object so it does not refer to the same memory location as the string literal "A". <p> Program 2 = correct becuase it compares the value of the string choice with the string literal "A".

4. No the season does not change at all because when the change_season(season) is called there is no reassaigining of the variable(or it's address, A100) from ```Winter``` to ```Spring```. This is because the method only modifies a local copy of the reference to the string.

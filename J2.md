# Worksheet 2

1.
```
Basic type = int a; double b;
```
```
Object = String s
```
2. <p> (a) Static method:- it is a declaration for classes which allows data and function to be accessible within the class without having to instantiate an object instance of that class as an object. <br> (b) When we are executing the main method of a class we're not instantiating an instance of the class as an object and then calling main. We are essentially calling the main directly or statically without an instance.

3. <p> Problem 1 = Wrong, because it is using the '==' operator to comapre two strings, which checks for reference equality rather than value equality. The  string choice is created as a new String object so it does not refer to the same memory location as the string literal "A". <p> Program 2 = correct becuase it compares the value of the string choice with the string literal "A".

4. No the season does not change at all because when the change_season(season) is called there is no reassaigining of the variable(or it's address, A100) from ```Winter``` to ```Spring```. This is because the method only modifies a local copy of the reference to the string.

5. Output is x = 0 and y = 0 because the constructor parameter shadow the instance variable x and y so when we call x=x and y = y it doesn't affect our instance variable which makes it retain its initial value of 0.

6. Private(visibility modifiers) it is used as a declaration on methods and object data to limit how programmers can use the object through information hiding. 

7.(Method Overloading) - the constructors have different types/ arguments so it mainly looks at the constructor calls to determine which constructor to use.

8. Option 4 is correct because it is declaring public x and y values that can be used to change the values of x and y because in the Point class the values are private. This is essential because since the x and y feilds in point class are private,so you cannot access or modify directly from the CustomPoint class.

9. Output = super(0,0) will not complile because you cannot call a superclass constructor after another statement.

10.The constructor call will set up the variables in the parent class and then changes can be made, so it will compile this time.

11. Option 2 is correct because the use of getX() and getY() is accessing the correct values of x and y to return the sum.

12. Protected modifier is a compromise between struct separation of interface from implemntation and a wild west all-fields are public approach. It basically enables subclasses to access certain members while keeping them hidden from unrelated classes. By doing so we maintain encapsulation and provide a controlled way to expose functionality for inheritance.

13.
```java
public FormulaOne(int n, Driver d, String make) {
     super(n,d);
     this.make = make;
}

public String toString() {
     return super.toString() +""+ make;
}
```

15. Neither because ``` addSponsor``` is not public instead it is protected
